#Create a program that computes simple interest. Prompt for the principal amount, the rate as a percentage, and the time, and display the amount accrued (principal + interest).
#The formula for simple interest is A = P(1 + rt), where P is the principal amount, r is the annual rate of interest, t is the number of years the amount is invested, and A is the amount at the end of the investment.
#       Enter the principal: 1500
#       Enter the rate of interest: 4.3
#       Enter the number of years: 4
#       After 4 years at 4.3%, the investment will
#       be worth $1758.
#Constraints
# Prompt for the rate as a percentage (like 15, not .15). Divide the input by 100 in your program.
# Ensure that fractions of a cent are rounded up to the next penny.
# Ensure that the output is formatted as money.
