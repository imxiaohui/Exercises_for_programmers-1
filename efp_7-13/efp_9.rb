#Sometimes you have to round up to the next number rather
#than follow standard rounding rules.
#Calculate gallons of paint needed to paint the ceiling of a room. Prompt for the length and width, and assume one gallon covers 350 square feet. Display the number of gallons needed to paint the ceiling as a whole number.
#Example Output
#       You will need to purchase 2 gallons of
#       paint to cover 360 square feet.
#Remember, you canâ€™t buy a partial gallon of paint. You must round up to the next whole gallon.
#Constraints
# Use a constant to hold the conversion rate.
# Ensure that you round up to the next whole number.
